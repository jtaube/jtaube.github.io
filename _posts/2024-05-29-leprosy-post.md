I enjoyed my recent visit to <a href="https://bymuseet.no/museum/lepramuseet/?lang=en">The Leprosy Museum at St. Jorgen’s Hospital</a> in Bergen, Norway. The museum has two excellent exhibits covering the social & scientific complexities of leprosy.

Leprosy cases in the 1800s were concentrated on the western coast of Norway. Many patients lived at St. Jorgen’s Hospital and most never left. Disease led to poverty either via social stigma or physical injury.

At the time, many assumed that the condition was inherited, while others thought it might be infectious. A detailed registry collected by Norwegians and a correlation between enforced isolation and decreased incidence supported the contagion hypothesis.

Later work by Armauer Hansen, a (controversial) Norwegian scientist, and Albert Neisser (think *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*) showed that *Mycobacterium leprae* caused leprosy. This work occurred just before the formalization of Koch’s postulates (which link diseases to their causative microbial agents).
