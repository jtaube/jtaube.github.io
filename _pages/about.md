# Hi! I'm Juliana.

I'm a third-year PhD student in Biology in the <a href='http://bansallab.com/'>Bansal Lab</a> at Georgetown University. My research explores the interplay between behavior and infectious disease, with a focus on how contact patterns vary across space, time, transmission modes, and disease states.

I'm also an <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/">NSF Graduate Research Fellow</a> and a member of the <a href="https://midasnetwork.us/midas-student/">MIDAS Trainee Network Executive Committee</a>. I graduated from Bowdoin College in 2021 where I studied math and biology. In 2019, I participated in an REU at the University of Georgia which sparked my interest in disease ecology. My full CV is available [here](/files/taube-cv.pdf).

Outside the lab, I enjoy experimenting with new recipes, playing ice hockey, and biking along the Potomac. 

Please reach out if you would like to collaborate or have questions about my work!
