Hello! I'm a Research Associate in the <a href='http://bansallab.com/'>Bansal Lab</a> at Georgetown University. In May 2021, I graduated from <a href='https://www.bowdoin.edu/'>Bowdoin College</a>, where I majored in Math and minored in Biology. Iâ€™m fascinated by infectious diseases and plan to attend graduate school to study infectious disease modeling. I'm most excited about questions exploring how human behavior impacts the spread of infectious diseases and vice versa. I define human behavior broadly, including both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions, heterogeneous contact and mobility patterns, sickness and avoidance behaviors, and shifting interactions at the human-animal interface. Outside the lab I spend a lot of time trying new recipes (photos to be added soon!) and riding my bike along the Potomac.
