Hello! I'm a Research Associate in the <a href='http://bansallab.com/'>Bansal Lab</a> at Georgetown University. In Fall 2023, I will be continuing in the Bansal Lab as a PhD student in Biology. In May 2021, I graduated from <a href='https://www.bowdoin.edu/'>Bowdoin College</a>, where I majored in Math and minored in Biology. My work focuses on the interplay between behavior and infectious disease, addressing questions about how behaviors vary over spatial and temporal scales, in an effort to better predict future coupled disease-behavior dynamics. Outside the lab I enjoy experimenting with new recipes and riding my bike along the Potomac.
