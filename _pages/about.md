Hello! I'm a first year PhD student in Biology in the <a href='http://bansallab.com/'>Bansal Lab</a> at Georgetown University. My research is focused on the feedback loop between behavior and infectious disease, including how disease-relevant behaviors (such as contact patterns, vaccination, and mask wearing) vary across space, time, individuals, and populations.  

I initially joined the Bansal Lab as a Research Associate in 2021 after graduating from <a href='https://www.bowdoin.edu/'>Bowdoin College</a>. For my senior thesis at Bowdoin I developed a dynamic disease-behavior network model that incorporated perceived risk and social influence. I was advised by Professors <a href="http://www.bowdoin.edu/~mirfan/">Mohammad Irfan</a> and <a href="https://www.bowdoin.edu/profiles/faculty/mlzeeman/">Mary Lou Zeeman</a>.

Outside the lab, I enjoy experimenting with new recipes and riding my bike along the Potomac.
