Hello! I'm a first year PhD student in Biology in the <a href='http://bansallab.com/'>Bansal Lab</a> at Georgetown University. Previously, I worked as a Research Associate in the Bansal Lab after graduating from <a href='https://www.bowdoin.edu/'>Bowdoin College</a> in 2021. My work focuses on the interplay between behavior and infectious disease, addressing questions about how public health behaviors vary over spatial and temporal scales, in an effort to better predict future coupled disease-behavior dynamics. Outside the lab I enjoy experimenting with new recipes and riding my bike along the Potomac.
