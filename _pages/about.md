Welcome! I'm a senior at <a href='https://www.bowdoin.edu/'>Bowdoin College</a> majoring in math and minoring in biology. I'm fascinated by infectious diseases and plan to attend graduate school to study infectious disease modeling. Outside of school, I enjoy playing ice hockey competitively and card games with friends. Most of my friends call me JJ.
