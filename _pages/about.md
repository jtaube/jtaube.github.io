Hello! I'm a second-year PhD student in Biology in the <a href='http://bansallab.com/'>Bansal Lab</a> at Georgetown University. My research is focused on the interplay between behavior and infectious disease, including how disease-relevant behaviors (such as contact patterns, vaccination, and mask wearing) vary across space, time, individuals, populations, and disease states. I am an NSF Graduate Research Fellow and a member of the <a href="https://midasnetwork.us/midas-student/">MIDAS Trainee Network Executive Committee</a>. 

My full CV is available [here](/files/taube-cv.pdf).

Outside the lab, I enjoy experimenting with new recipes, playing ice hockey, and riding my bike along the Potomac.
