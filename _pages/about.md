Hello! I'm a Research Associate in the <a href='https://bansallab.com/'>Bansal Lab</a> at Georgetown University. In May 2021, I graduated from <a href='https://www.bowdoin.edu/'>Bowdoin College</a>, where I majored in Math and minored in Biology. Iâ€™m fascinated by infectious diseases and plan to attend graduate school to study infectious disease modeling. I'm most excited about questions exploring how behavior impacts the spread of infectious diseases at the population level but am also interested in projects that consider how changes in climate may heterogeneously affect vector-borne diseases both spatially and temporally. At Bowdoin, I served as a teaching assistant for the Computer Science, Math, and Digital and Computational Studies Departments, which indulged my enthusiasm for programming and helping others. Outside the classroom, I played Division III ice hockey.
