Hello! I'm a senior at <a href='https://www.bowdoin.edu/'>Bowdoin College</a> majoring in Math and minoring in Biology. I'm fascinated by infectious diseases and plan to attend graduate school to study infectious disease modeling. Currently, I'm interested in how contact pattern and disease transmission heterogeneity affects disease dynamics. At Bowdoin, I serve as a teaching assistant for the Computer Science Department, which indulges my enthusiasm for programming and data wrangling. Outside of school, I enjoy playing ice hockey competitively and card games with friends, most of whom call me JJ.
