# Hi! I'm Juliana.

I'm a third-year PhD candidate in Biology in the <a href='http://bansallab.com/'>Bansal Lab</a> at Georgetown University and an <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/">NSF Graduate Research Fellow</a>. My research explores the interplay between behavior and infectious disease, with a focus on how contact patterns vary across space, time, transmission modes, and disease states.

Prior to graduate school, I studied math and biology at Bowdoin College and participated in the <a href="https://reu.ecology.uga.edu/">PopBio REU</a> at the University of Georgia. My full CV is available [here](/files/taube-cv.pdf).

Outside the lab, I enjoy experimenting with new recipes, playing ice hockey, and biking along the Potomac. 

Please reach out if you would like to collaborate or have questions about my work!
