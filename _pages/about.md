Hello! Soon I’ll be joining the <a href='https://bansallab.com/'>Bansal Lab</a> as a research associate. In May 2021 I graduated from <a href='https://www.bowdoin.edu/'>Bowdoin College</a> where I majored in Math and minored in Biology. I’m fascinated by infectious diseases and plan to attend graduate school to study infectious disease modeling. Currently, I’m interested in how contact pattern and disease transmission heterogeneities affect disease dynamics. At Bowdoin, I served as a teaching assistant for the Computer Science, Math, and Digital and Computational Studies Departments which indulged my enthusiasm for programming and helping others. Outside the classroom, I played Division III ice hockey.
