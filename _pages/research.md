## Current projects:

<ul>
<li> I have recently started two new projects in the Bansal Lab. In response to the current monkeypox outbreak, we are mapping the smallpox immune landscape at a fine spatial resolution worldwide, utilizing demographic and vaccination cessation and coverage data. Additionally, I am examining spatiotemporal heterogeneity in self-reported numbers of non-household contacts across several groups in the U.S., including people of different ages, with or without previous COVID-19 infection, and varying reported worry about severe COVID-19 infection. </li>

<li> For my undergraduate honors thesis, I constructed a SARS-CoV-2 coupled disease-behavior dynamical model. We used networks to account for heterogeneous contact patterns and influence games to capture social influence and inform decisions about masking behavior. I was advised on this project by Professors <a href="http://www.bowdoin.edu/~mirfan/">Mohammad Irfan</a> and <a href="https://www.bowdoin.edu/profiles/faculty/mlzeeman/">Mary Lou Zeeman</a>. We are currently extending the analysis for submission for publication. </li>
