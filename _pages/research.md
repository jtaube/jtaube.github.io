It can take a while for a project to reach the stage where it is ready for presentation or publication -- so here's a snapshot of what I'm working on right now.

* <b> Disentangling aerosol and droplet respiratory disease transmission routes </b> 
  * Using outbreak reports, laboratory transmission experiments, and contact data, I am characterizing how contact structure varies across different pathogen transmission modes and the implications of this variation for disease dynamics. 
* <b> Quantifying the social and disease effects of hygienic behaviors across species & scales </b> 
  * I am integrating data from experimental and observational studies of hygienic behaviors into animal social contact networks to understand how these behavior changes alter social structure and disease dynamics across animal species.
