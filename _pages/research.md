<ul>
<li> My most recent project in the Bansal Lab examines spatiotemporal heterogeneity in self-reported numbers of non-household contacts across several groups in the U.S., including people of different ages, with or without previous COVID-19 infection, and varying reported worry about severe COVID-19 infection. While this study focuses on contact during the COVID-19 pandemic, by leveraging responses from other survey questions we are able to characterize recent contact patterns in the U.S.</li>

<li> For my undergraduate honors thesis, I constructed a SARS-CoV-2 coupled disease-behavior dynamical model, that incorporated heterogeneous contact patterns and dynamic thresholds for masking behavior change based on individuals' perceived risk and social influence. I was advised on this project by Professors <a href="http://www.bowdoin.edu/~mirfan/">Mohammad Irfan</a> and <a href="https://www.bowdoin.edu/profiles/faculty/mlzeeman/">Mary Lou Zeeman</a>. We are currently extending the analysis for submission for publication. </li>
