For my undergraduate honors thesis I am constructing a SARS-CoV-2 disease transmission model. We use networks to account for heterogeneous contact patterns and influence games to capture social influence and decisions about masking and social distancing behaviors. This work is inspired by and will expand on that of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mbs.2012.04.003">Poletti and colleagues</a> by eliminating the assumption of homogeneous mixing and incorporating individual variation in willingness to mask and social distance, for example. I'm advised on this project by Professors <a href="http://www.bowdoin.edu/~mirfan/">Mohammad Irfan</a> and <a href="https://www.bowdoin.edu/profiles/faculty/mlzeeman/">Mary Lou Zeeman</a>.
