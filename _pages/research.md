<li> <b> Disentangling aerosol and droplet respiratory disease transmission routes </b> 

Using outbreak reports, laboratory transmission experiments, and contact data, I am characterizing how contact structure varies across different pathogen transmission modes and the implications of this variation for disease dynamics. </li>

<li> <b> Quantifying the social and disease effects of hygienic behaviors across species & scales </b> 

I am integrating data from experimental and observational studies of hygienic behaviors into animal social contact networks to understand how these behavior changes alter social structure and disease dynamics across animal species.  </li>
