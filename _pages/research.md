<ul>
<li> In the Bansal Lab, I am conducting a comparative analysis of survey data on masking behavior across the US. We assess whether different datasets show the same masking trends over time and space and interpret these trends. This project has introduced me to partial pooling/mixed-effects models, which I look forward to incorporating into my work in the future.</li>

<li> For my undergraduate honors thesis, I constructed a SARS-CoV-2 coupled disease-behavior dynamical model. We used networks to account for heterogeneous contact patterns and influence games to capture social influence and inform decisions about masking behavior. I was advised on this project by Professors <a href="http://www.bowdoin.edu/~mirfan/">Mohammad Irfan</a> and <a href="https://www.bowdoin.edu/profiles/faculty/mlzeeman/">Mary Lou Zeeman</a>. We are currently extending the analysis for submission for publication. </li>
