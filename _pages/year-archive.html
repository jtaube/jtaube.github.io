I use this blog as a venue to practice my science communication skills.
Currently, most posts are lightly edited archives of Twitter threads I (or my coauthors) posted summarizing recent work. 
I hope to upload additional coding tips in 2025.

{% include base_path %}
{% capture written_year %}'None'{% endcapture %}
{% for post in site.posts %}
  {% capture year %}{{ post.date | date: '%Y' }}{% endcapture %}
  {% if year != written_year %}
    <h2 id="{{ year | slugify }}" class="archive__subtitle">{{ year }}</h2>
    {% capture written_year %}{{ year }}{% endcapture %}
  {% endif %}
  {% include archive-single.html %}
{% endfor %}
